# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Implemented the Sprint 1 `info <file>` path with read-only file mapping, ELF64 x86_64 validation, basic ELF metadata reporting, and invalid-input regression tests.
- Added `src/info.asm` as the command orchestrator that preserves boundaries between file mapping, ELF validation, reporting, and cleanup.
- Added a mapped-file internal record layout in `include/structs.inc`.
- Added stable STDERR diagnostics for file, ELF identity, malformed ELF, unsupported, and bounds-related failures.
- Added fixed-width `print_hex64` formatting for deterministic metadata output.

### Fixed

- Prevented Docker bind-mounted development sessions from creating root-owned build artifacts by running Docker shells/tests with the caller's UID/GID.
- Added `.dockerignore` to keep local context, generated artifacts, `.git/`, and private/course files out of Docker build contexts.
- Added troubleshooting documentation for `make clean` permission failures caused by root-owned generated files.

### Added

- `make docker-test` for reproducible container smoke testing.
- `make ownership-check` and `make fix-perms` for diagnosing and repairing local generated artifact ownership issues.

All notable public changes to x64lens will be documented in this file.

The project follows semantic versioning once the first public release is cut.

## [0.1.0-dev] - Unreleased

### Added

- Repository skeleton for an assembly-first ELF64 analysis research prototype.
- NASM build contract using `make`.
- CLI command contract for `info`, `mitigations`, `gadgets`, `analyze`, `bench`, and `version`.
- Documentation contracts for development, research, output, benchmark, and release discipline.
- Initial research questions RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3.
- Initial JSON schema draft.
- Sprint planning documents.
- Development environment plan for WSL2, Docker/devcontainer, remote development, and publication benchmarks.
- Visualization plan with Mermaid and Graphviz source diagrams.
- Human-readable comments across current assembly, config, script, and workflow scaffolding.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for reproducible development environments.

### Changed

- Public documentation is now separated from local-only private project context.
- Local-only planning/context files are expected under `.local/project-context/` and excluded by `.gitignore`.
- Makefile scaffold checks now validate only public repository structure.

### Planned

- Sprint 1: implement file mapping and ELF64 header validation.
- Sprint 2: implement program header parsing, executable region discovery, and baseline mitigation reporting.
- Sprint 3: implement raw gadget candidate scanning.
